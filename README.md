# Timcat -- TiMOS ssh exec

## Summary

Timcat facilitates easy, simple CLI automation of devices running TiMOS,
Alcatel-Lucent's OS for their _7xxx Service Router_ platform. It allows you to
issue commands (and hookup stdio), to a TiMOS device with the SSHv2 server
enabled.

## Example

The following example uses the default login (admin/admin) to issue commands
from the command line, and from stdin. I simply filled stdin (using echo) with
a TiMOS CLI command to mimic the familiar _uptime_ command.


timcat is simple to use

      $ timcat -H sr7host -- "show version"

      INFO: connecting to sr7host (***.***.***.***) on port 22
      
      *A:sr7host# show version

timcat can read commands from argv

      $ timcat -H sr7host -- "show card state"

      INFO: connecting to sr7host (***.***.***.***) on port 22
      *A:sr7host# show system information | match "System Up Time"
      System Up Time         : 9 days, 14:28:15.45 (hr:min:sec)


timcat can read commands from stdin

      $ echo 'show system information | match "System Up Time"' | timcat -H sr7host

## Background

I've been working with Alcatel-Lucent's Service Router platform since late
2007\. Much of my work has been focused on automation and management. Before 
the development of NETCONF, the options were: SNMP, Tcl/Expect, or 
Alcatel-Lucent's 5620 SAM.

I believe that traditional CLI interfaces are, the most powerful, simple, and 
flexible way to operate any device.  I was sick of writing one-off scripts in 
TCL to perform simple tasks on a TiMOS node, so I made this program.
